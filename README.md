### Hangman Game

**Description:**
This Hangman game is a fun, interactive word-guessing challenge, now built with React! Originally developed using plain HTML and JavaScript, the app has been modernized to take advantage of React's component-based architecture, making it more maintainable and scalable.

**Features:**
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Word Selection:** Randomly selects words from a predefined list or an external API for a dynamic experience.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Users guess letters and receive instant feedback on correct or incorrect guesses.
- **Visual Feedback:** A hangman graphic updates with each wrong guess, providing a visual representation of remaining attempts.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of wins and losses, allowing users to improve their guessing skills over time.
- **Restart Functionality:** Users can easily restart the game without needing to refresh the page.
- **Accessibility Features:** Designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring all players can enjoy the game.

**Technologies Used:**
- **React:** For building a modular and responsive user interface.
- **CSS:** For styling components and ensuring a polished look.
- **JavaScript:** To handle game logic and interactions.
- **GitHub:** For version control and collaborative development.

**How to Play:**
1. Start the game to receive a randomly selected word.
2. Guess letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess will draw part of the hangman.
3. The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn!
4. Enjoy replaying to beat your previous score!

**Installation Instructions:**
Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to launch the game locally.

**Contributing:**
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to enhance the game or add new features.
